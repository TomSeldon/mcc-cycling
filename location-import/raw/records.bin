Historically as a result of the paper pulp colouring the water as it flowed down stream, the property gave name to the village of White – brook. <br /><br />Today the house sits in 3.5 acres of landscaped gardens and woodlands and fronts onto Mill Ponds, the gardens themselves have been landscaped by a double gold winner at the Chelsea Flower show and feature oak boardwalks and woodland pathways. <br /><br />Visitors enter the property through electronic gates and are able to park in a large secure parking area overlooking the house,old mill and mill ponds.

While South Wales has a profusion of Victorian and Edwardian gardens that remain open to the public, there are very few top quality modern ones. Veddw may be the best of the bunch and it’s certainly one of the finest contemporary gardens in the country. At around four acres the grounds are generous rather than sprawling but there is still plenty to see. <br /><br />The first thing many visitors notice is the dramatic use of colour. Rather than the classical green foliage familiar from traditional garden designs, the creators of Veddw Gardens use silver and purple foliage to add interest to hedges and borders. Many of the benches and outbuildings are contemporary but tasteful, meshing beautifully with the garden around them. <br /><br />In line with modern thoughts to ecologically friendly gardening, meadow grasses are used to deepen the contrast between precise hedges any classical topiary garden would be proud of and Veddw’s more casual, wilder side. <br /><br />For many people the focus of the garden is the dramatic, black, reflecting pool, which faces and reflects a garden of clipped hedges, shaped to echo the undulating hills of the surrounding countryside.<br /><br />Elsewhere, there is a garden filled with contrasting silver cardoons and purple heuchera, backed by a border of mixed silver and purple shrubs. There are numerous colour themed borders and gardens which also include a creative use of grasses. The owners have a great interest in the local landscape history and have incorporated this interest into the garden design, in particular in a large parterre of ornamental grasses spread across a small hillside within a pattern of box hedges based on the Tithe Map of 1842.<br /><br />The conservatory is painted black, creating a perfect and unusual backdrop to massed silver succulents. The wild garden, in contrast, contains robust perennials planted in the original ancient grassland. Elsewhere that grassland has been retained in a large area which has been carefully nurtured for 25 years, resulting in a flower rich meadow of the kind older people remember from their childhood.<br /><br />The ruin of a cottage has been adapted to make unusual seating place, with a quiet view into the old coppice filled with the periwinkle which was probably planted by the cottagers many years ago.<br /><br />The garden is starred in the Good Gardens Guide, has been widely featured in books and reviewed on the web. The owners and designers are Anne Wareham, who has recently published a book about the garden “The Bad Tempered Gardener”, and her photographer husband, Charles Hawes who took the photographs for the book and whose award winning photographs may be found in many garden publications.            </p>";s:9:"post_type";s:14:"mcc-activities";s:6:"images";a:2:{i:0;a:2:{s:3:"alt";s:18:"Veddw House Garden";s:3:"src";s:120:"http://www.ntopsearch.com/media/images/2/d/2dbbac2e-6bbd-4997-a241-8df018da8262/2dbbac2e-6bbd-4997-a241-8df018da8262.jpg";}i:1;a:2:{s:3:"alt";s:18:"Veddw House Garden";s:3:"src";s:120:"http://www.ntopsearch.com/media/images/c/3/c399fc99-8ce1-4b0d-8f55-eb5797b849b5/c399fc99-8ce1-4b0d-8f55-eb5797b849b5.jpg";}}}s:9:"post_meta";O:8:"stdClass":4:{s:8:"location";a:5:{s:3:"lat";s:8:"51.68426";s:3:"lng";s:9:"-2.734801";s:10:"center_lat";s:8:"51.68426";s:10:"center_lng";s:9:"-2.734801";s:7:"address";s:20:"Monmouthshire, Wales";}s:9:"telephone";s:16:"+44 01291 650836";s:5:"email";s:16:"anne@veddw.co.uk";s:7:"website";s:20:"http://www.veddw.com";}}i:27;a:2:{s:4:"post";O:8:"stdClass":4:{s:10:"post_title";s:39:"Parva Farm Vineyard, Wine and Gift Shop";s:12:"post_content";s:438:"<p>              The vineyard produces award-winning wines, meads and sparkling wines for all occasions. <br /><br />The farm is tended by its owners, Judith and Colin Dudley.

home is in the special small historic market town of Abergavenny which is surrounded by beautiful mountains. It is called the 'Gateway to Wales'. It is a perfect base for a walking or cycling holiday. We are very conveniently positioned being just 3 minute walk from the train station and 5 minute walk from the bus station and the main shops are just beyond this. For those travelling by car, we have offstreet parking. <br /><br />Abergavenny is famous for its Food Festival in September. It is known as an area with lots of good places to eat out. <br /><br />We've been running a small B&B registered with the Wales Tourist Board for the last 2 years and have already had several repeat guests and many nice comments in our guest book regarding the warm welcome, nice food, comfortable accommodation etc. We enjoy welcoming people from many different countries and we have lived and travelled in a variety of developing countries ourselves and have grown-up children living in Sydney, New York and England. We use locally sourced and Fairtrade products whenever possible and make our own bread and preserves. <br /><br />We serve home made cakes to welcome our guests on arrival. The main guest bedroom has a very comfortable king size bed which has its own bathroom just one metre away. (Note we have removed the listing for a twin room on the top floor as it caused confusion with pricing. If guests need 2 rooms e.g. for a family or if 2 couples come together this is possible but we do not let this room separately as there is only a one bathroom. We charge £40 for this additional room for 2 people.) Both rooms have TV and WiFi, the main room has DVD too. We potentially have off street parking. <br /><br />The usual charge per night is £40 for bed and cooked British breakfast for ONE person. Additional nights are charged at £32 per night for one person. For double occupancy, the charge is £55 the first night and £46 for subsequent nights. We offer further reduced rates for extended stays. <br /><br />Please note we do have one cat but this is kept in the back area of the house completely away from guest areas.            </p>";s:9:"post_type";s:17:"mcc-accommodation";s:6:"images";a:4:{i:0;a:2:{s:3:"alt";s:20:"Morgan&#39;s B&amp;B";s:3:"src";s:120:"http://www.ntopsearch.com/media/images/8/8/88906dbc-ed43-4da4-99bc-adf58e54cdd6/88906dbc-ed43-4da4-99bc-adf58e54cdd6.jpg";}i:1;a:2:{s:3:"alt";s:20:"Morgan&#39;s B&amp;B";s:3:"src";s:120:"http://www.ntopsearch.com/media/images/0/d/0dd2aac3-f47c-4df8-b11c-556856a57973/0dd2aac3-f47c-4df8-b11c-556856a57973.jpg";}i:2;a:2:{s:3:"alt";s:20:"Morgan&#39;s B&amp;B";s:3:"src";s:120:"http://www.ntopsearch.com/media/images/9/c/9c8b5226-d068-421a-9526-614225c875ab/9c8b5226-d068-421a-9526-614225c875ab.jpg";}i:3;a:2:{s:3:"alt";s:20:"Morgan&#39;s B&amp;B";s:3:"src";s:120:"http://www.ntopsearch.com/media/images/2/9/2946ffe0-0b7b-4924-b950-478e7a18db7e/2946ffe0-0b7b-4924-b950-478e7a18db7e.jpg";}}}s:9:"post_meta";O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:8:"location";a:5:{s:3:"lat";s:8:"51.81847";s:3:"lng";s:9:"-3.012589";s:10:"center_lat";s:8:"51.81847";s:10:"center_lng";s:9:"-3.012589";s:7:"address";s:20:"Monmouthshire, Wales";}s:9:"telephone";s:16:"+44 01873 850651";s:5:"email";s:19:"marynepal@gmail.com";s:7:"website";s:0:"";s:10:"facilities";s:2680:"<ul>                                <li>                      <h4>Facilities</h4>                                                    <ul>                                                        <li><span>Central heating throughout</span></li>                                                        <li><span>Garden/patio for guests' use</span></li>                                                        <li><span>Ironing facilities </span></li>                                                        <li><span>Non smoking establishment</span></li>                                                        <li><span>Number of shared bathrooms: 1</span></li>                                                        <li><span>Wireless/internet access</span></li>                                                        </ul>                                            </li>                                <li>                      <h4>Bedroom Facilities</h4>                                                    <ul>                                                        <li><span>CD player</span></li>                                                        <li><span>Hairdryer in all bedrooms</span></li>                                                        <li><span>Radio in all bedrooms</span></li>                                                        <li><span>Tea & coffee making facilities in all bedrooms</span></li>                                                        </ul>                                            </li>                                <li>                      <h4>Catering</h4>                                                    <ul>                                                        <li><span>Cater for vegetarians</span></li>                                                        </ul>                                            </li>                                <li>                      <h4>Children's Facilities</h4>                                                    <ul>                                                        <li><span>Accept children</span></li>                                                        <li><span>Highchair</span></li>                                                        </ul>                                            </li>                                <li>                      <h4>Leisure Facilities</h4>                                                    <ul>                                                        <li><span>Cycle hire</span></li>                                                        </ul>                                            </li>                                </ul>";s:13:"accessibility";s:179:"<p>              The accommodation has not had any special adaptations for disabled guests.

Since 2002, the hotel has been privately owned, and run, by Caradog Hotels. <br /><br />Right in the centre of the bustling market town of Abergavenny, the hotel combines the friendly ambience of a private residence with a high level of accommodation and service. With 31 en-suite rooms located in the hotel, 2 en-suite rooms in The Mews and also The Lodge and Castle Street Cottage. The Welsh Tourist Board and The AA have rated the hotel with three stars. The hotel has also been awarded with an AA rosette for the standard of the cuisine and features in various eating out guides for the area.<br /><br />We serve a wide range of local produce prepared to the highest standard from 12-2.30pm and 7-10pm, seven days a week.  If you fancy something lighter, why not try one of our infamous traditional Afternoon Teas?  Mrs. Sally Lane bakes biscuits, cakes, pastries and scones on the premises daily.  This year we received the Top City and Country Hotel Afternoon Tea Award 2011 from the Tea Guild.<br /><br />Our wine list contains a very good range to suit every taste and budget, including some great wines by the glass.  Every year since 2005 we have been honoured with the Wine Spectator's Award of Excellence.            </p>";s:9:"post_type";s:17:"mcc-accommodation";s:6:"images";a:5:{i:0;a:2:{s:3:"alt";s:15:"The

</ul>";s:13:"accessibility";s:5958:"<p>              ACCESS STATEMENT   The Hotel Building  •	The Angel Hotel was built in the 1800s, and due to the nature of the architecture there exist many potential barriers to being accessible to all.  We have, however, taken reasonable measures to ensure that people with a disability can use our facilities, and the improvements are ongoing.  Public Transport •	Abergavenny railway station is located approximately 15 minutes away on foot, or less than 5 minutes by car.  A regular taxi service is available outside the station.  Alternatively, pre-arrange with us for a taxi to collect you. •	Abergavenny bus station is located approximately 5 minutes away on foot.  The main street linking the railway and bus stations to the hotel is in good condition with well-maintained pavements. •	From the railway station, 5 side streets must be crossed to reach the hotel, and 1 side street from the bus station. •	We are happy to arrange a taxi on your behalf with one of the many local taxi firms. •	For directions to the hotel, please visit our website (www.angelhotelabergavenny.com) or ring for more verbal or visual information.  Car Park and Rear Entrance •	We have our own car parking facilities to the rear of the hotel with provision for 30 cars.  When this is full, there is a large public car park opposite the rear of the hotel, available at a small premium. •	Access to the hotel from the car park (23.3 metres) is via an open passage at a slight gradient. •	On entering the rear porch way, five steps (17 cm high and 28 cm deep) descend onto a small area.  There are handrails on both sides of the stairway.  Another small stone step brings you into the courtyard. •	The most accessible route from the courtyard into the ground floor of the hotel is to go through the door on your left hand side.  A small step up leads to double doors that swing outwards.  Drop-off Point •	Outside the front of the hotel is a drop-off point (off the main street – Cross Street). •	It is not particularly large, however, and is frequently used, s o it would be worth informing us prior to arrival if you are intending on using this facility. •	A member of staff will always be willing to assist guests from the drop-off point to the hotel entrance (3 metres), if necessary.  Main Entrance •	Access to the ground floor of the hotel is via two steps (9 cm and 16 cm high) leading to a double door (176 cm wide). •	We can provide a temporary ramp (90 cm long) at the main entrance, resulting in gradients of 1:10 and 1:7 respectively.  One of our receptionists will be happy to assist in arranging this. •	The ground floor is level throughout, with the exception of one step up (14 cm high) to the sitting room. •	Please note that the temporary ramp can be used throughout the hotel as appropriate for your convenience.  Toilet Facilities •	Currently we have no accessible toilets on the ground floor.  However, we are completing ongoing renovations, and are planning to provide accessible toilet facilities in the near future. •	The dimensions of our existing ground floor toilet facilities are as follows:  Ladies				Gents 	Width of Entrance Door:		73.5 cm			72 cm 	Width of Cubical Doors:		66.5 cm			63 cm 	Dimensions of Cubical:		135 x 80 cm			120 x 70 cm  Reception •	The reception area is well lit.  Lighting can be increased where necessary. •	The reception desk is 106 cm high.  Alternatively, one of our receptionists can come to you.  Access to Main Public Areas •	The restaurant is accessed via a door with a width of 86 cm.  The restaurant is large with good spacing between tables.  There is also a clear passage way to all tables.  We will always be happy to assist you in selecting a suitable table, and in removing chairs or storing wheelchairs where necessary. •	Large print menus are available on request, or a member or staff will be able to assist you in reading the menu if you so wish. •	The Foxhunter Bar can be accessed from both the front and rear entrances.  Both doors are 75cm wide.  Again, we will be happy to assist you in your selection of a suitable table and to move furniture accordingly. •	The sitting room is accessed via a 14 cm high step up and through an 84 cm wide door.  Here you will find comfortable sofas and armchairs.  Tables in this area are lower (average 45 cm) than in the restaurant and bar (average 75 cm). •	Waitress service is provided in all of the three main eating and drinking areas mentioned above. •	Doors into the main public areas are usually held open.  If a door is closed, a member of staff will be happy to assist you.  Function Rooms •	We have three function rooms.  The Ballroom, suitable for the larger-style function, and the Brecon Suite, suitable for meetings and smaller functions, are located on the first floor. •	The Ballroom has double doors with a total width of 121.5 cm.  The bar area adjacent to the Ballroom is accessed via two steps upon which a temporary ramp can be placed (gradient 1:3.5). •	The door to the Brecon Suite is 81 cm wide.  Two steps (each with a height of 15 cm) lead from the main corridor to the entrance. •	We do not currently have a lift in the hotel.  However, we are willing to assist access to the first and second floors in whichever ways possible. •	The Ballroom has its own entrance from the car park (148 cm wide).  We will happily assist you in using this entrance to the first floor via a temporary ramp (gradient 1:3). •	The Wedgewood Room, our third function room, is located on the ground floor.  There are two entrances, with widths of 133 cm and 88.5 cm respectively.  Guestrooms •	Currently, all of our 30 guest rooms are located on the first and second floors. •	All standard rooms are equipped with cordless kettles.  Superior and deluxe rooms do not have tea and coffee making facilities, but we provide a room service for these at no additional cost.               </p>";}}i:54;a:2:{s:4:"post";O:8:"stdClass":4:{s:10:"post_title";s:12:"Penylan Farm";s:12:"post_content";s:1492:"<p>              The perfect relaxing country holiday at our converted oak beamed granary set in its own courtyard on a working farm. <br /><br />Breakfasts focus on local produce as much as possible with free range eggs from the farm when available and fresh apple juice from a farm nearby.<br /><br />Skirted either side by the Wye Valley and Black Mountains, Penylan (top of the hill) is situated in the Parish of Llangattock-vibon-Avel and was originally part of the historic Hendre Estate which was owned by the Rolls family.

Brynhonddu Country House B&B is set within the Main Estate House of Bwlch Trewyn Estate, in the foothills of the Black Mountains, on the eastern side if the Brecon Beacons National Park. The terrain is hilly and the roads around the property are inclined. It would be difficult for guests with more than the minimum of mobility problems, to cope with the slopes around the property if they expected to travel on foot. We have within the property stairs up to the bed room accommodation, which should cause no trouble to guests that are able to cope with normal upper floor access.  Wheelchair access to the ground floor area is possible, but we have no lift facilities within the building to the upper floors.                 </p>";}}i:56;a:2:{s:4:"post";O:8:"stdClass":4:{s:10:"post_title";s:13:"Parsons Grove";s:12:"post_content";s:564:"<p>              Parsons Grove has 2 dedicated cottages, Beech Cottage and Ash Cottage, providing private ensuite bed and breakfast facilities.

Since then there has been extensive refurbishment internally and externally,  including individually designed en-suite bedrooms.  Local produce is used wherever possible in the 'prepared to order' meals which the team of chefs create for the light meals, bar snacks, 'modern british' restaurant menu and daily fish and meat specials available in the beamed, bar and restaurant as well as in the outdoor eating area - a newly created terrace garden with splendid views.<br /><br />There are 15 en-suite bedrooms, all non-smoking.

It is interesting to think that the stones used in the building may have come from Chepstow Castle, just across the road, which by that time had fallen into disuse. The solid walls and foundations of the original building are up to five feet thick, tapering to a mere three feet to carry the seasoned oak roof supports.<br /><br />Two bedrooms and the dining room (originally a kitchen) were added about 150 years ago and the small 18thC cottage next door was recently purchased and integrated into the hotel, to provide a cosy residents lounge and the Cottage Suite. The Hotel Restaurant offers imaginative dishes, well prepared from freshly delivered local produce. Many old favourite dishes, plus some different and interesting snacks are available from our bar.<br /><br />The aim of the Hotel is to offer its guests comfort, good food and personal attention in surroundings which retain the charm of the 18thC.            </p>";s:9:"post_type";s:17:"mcc-accommodation";s:6:"images";a:1:{i:0;a:2:{s:3:"alt";s:17:"Castle View Hotel";s:3:"src";s:120:"http://www.ntopsearch.com/media/images/2/b/2b479286-f0da-4248-9923-8fcf930173f2/2b479286-f0da-4248-9923-8fcf930173f2.jpg";}}}s:9:"post_meta";O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:8:"location";a:5:{s:3:"lat";s:8:"51.63926";s:3:"lng";s:9:"-2.675939";s:10:"center_lat";s:8:"51.63926";s:10:"center_lng";s:9:"-2.675939";s:7:"address";s:20:"Monmouthshire, Wales";}s:9:"telephone";s:16:"+44 01291 620349";s:5:"email";s:29:"castleviewhotel@btconnect.com";s:7:"website";s:30:"http://www.hotelchepstow.co.uk";s:10:"facilities";s:1080:"<ul>                                <li>                      <h4>Facilities</h4>                                                    <ul>                                                        <li><span>Public telephone </span></li>                                                        </ul>                                            </li>                                <li>                      <h4>Bedroom Facilities</h4>                                                    <ul>                                                        <li><span>Colour TV in all bedrooms</span></li>                                                        </ul>                                            </li>                                <li>                      <h4>Children's Facilities</h4>                                                    <ul>                                                        <li><span>Accept children</span></li>                                                        </ul>                                            </li>                                </ul>";s:13:"accessibility";s:33:"<p>                          </p>";}}i:74;a:2:{s:4:"post";O:8:"stdClass":4:{s:10:"post_title";s:27:"Gentle Jane Bed & Breakfast";s:12:"post_content";s:692:"<p>              In the middle of rural Monmouthshire. on the Welsh side of the border with England lies the ancient village of Grosmont - castle, church, pub and post office and four hundred souls.

Plas Derwen is a fantastic pub restaurant which offers exceptional food at ordinary prices. Located within easy reach of the A40 and A465 (Heads of the Valleys Road), it was redeveloped to a high standard in April 2007.  All our food is cooked to order, using produce from local suppliers, listed on the back of our weekly changing menus, enabling you to have a different dish with every visit.  There is also a Specials board and a Fish Specials board for even more variety.  This is a warm, welcoming venue with pastel colours and a large see through feature fireplace.  The building dates back 600 years and the refurbishment has been sympathetically undertaken to reflect old meeting new.  With contemporary furnishing, the traditional slant has been retained with many nooks and crannies around the pub.  The Garden Room, Lounge Bar and double Conservatory are separate rooms offering different experiences.  Some areas have leather sofas and leather tub chairs.  Because we dont have loud music or TVs to interrupt your visit, you can enjoy a conversation or be by yourself and have a quiet drink / meal or sit with a book or newspaper.  Set in fabulous surroundings, outdoors is just as pleasing an experience having walled mature gardens with trees and a lovely willow tree in the corner.  It is ideal for children to explore and play, whilst you enjoy some relaxing refreshment.  There is also a large patio seating area with tables and chairs which is great for al fresco dining.

example of what much of Abergavenny would have looked like before formal Georgian modifications. In 1625, Charles II on his flight from defeat at Naseby stayed at the coaching inn and again much later in his flights from the Parliamentarians. In the 19th Century, a sculptor was commissioned to carve a coat of arms to commemorate the royal patronage. This is now restored over the front of building.

Hypoallergenic bedding, ironing boards and clothes drying are also available. <br /><br />The comfortable and gracious sitting room is a perfect place to read, enjoy the scenery and warm wood fires on chilly evenings, with scenic routes, walking maps, local interest legends and guide books to browse, along with binoculars and hand-made walking sticks to take along on explorations. <br /><br />Lovingly prepared breakfasts including wonderful local sausages, kippers, freshly made bread, organic muesli, yogurt and berries. Marcel, our 'French Maitre d' will describe the daily specials (look for him in the breakfast room picture :) <br />Delicious packed lunches and cream teas are also available, and with advance request, freshly prepared homemade dinners as well. Several excellent traditional pubs and restaurants in Tintern are a short stroll away, serving Wye Valley specialties, local wines and ales.<br /><br />With an original croquet ground and badminton

acres of family farmland.<br /><br />Ideally located for business or holiday visitors the tranquil setting is perfect for relaxation and enjoyment of all that Monmouthshire has to offer: beautiful countryside, historic castles, Roman remains, walking, riding and of course, golf.  The Ryder Cup 2010 venue is only 4 miles away.<br /><br />Parking off the quiet lane, enter the Courtyard through double doors and take in the summertime perfume of lavender and roses. On into the beautifully converted stables to find a sitting/dining room with honey coloured flagstone floor, beams and an exquisite mix of ancient and modern to give an elegant 21century take on living.<br /><br />The well proportioned bedroom, with solid oak floor is chic and equipped with all expected of boutique accommodation, including a table suitable for working on your computer, finishing notes after a busy day or making sketches of the beautiful views you may have experienced during your stay. The private bathroom, finished to the highest standard, has slate floor and glass brick panels to separate the bath and large open shower.<br /><br />Breakfast will be from a selection of local produce and an evening meal is available by prior arrangement.<br /><br />Room Price: £70.00 per night.            </p>";s:9:"post_type";s:17:"mcc-accommodation";s:6:"images";a:6:{i:0;a:2:{s:3:"alt";s:13:"The Courtyard";s:3:"src";s:120:"http://www.ntopsearch.com/media/images/2/9/29711b85-f253-4332-8c33-8abe807b0970/29711b85-f253-4332-8c33-8abe807b0970.jpg";}i:1;a:2:{s:3:"alt";s:13:"The Courtyard";s:3:"src";s:120:"http://www.ntopsearch.com/media/images/2/a/2af425e9-0680-4d5f-ab3c-aad1bbe610cb/2af425e9-0680-4d5f-ab3c-aad1bbe610cb.jpg";}i:2;a:2:{s:3:"alt";s:13:"The Courtyard";s:3:"src";s:120:"http://www.ntopsearch.com/media/images/e/6/e689d81f-dff6-4ca2-9453-752b65bae3a7/e689d81f-dff6-4ca2-9453-752b65bae3a7.jpg";}i:3;a:2:{s:3:"alt";s:13:"The Courtyard";s:3:"src";s:120:"http://www.ntopsearch.com/media/images/1/7/17e03869-ab38-4d0b-aaae-0089bc99f874/17e03869-ab38-4d0b-aaae-0089bc99f874.jpg";}i:4;a:2:{s:3:"alt";s:13:"The Courtyard";s:3:"src";s:120:"http://www.ntopsearch.com/media/images/4/d/4da58b5f-8694-4090-ab08-10e3424b0c6e/4da58b5f-8694-4090-ab08-10e3424b0c6e.jpg";}i:5;a:2:{s:3:"alt";s:13:"The Courtyard";s:3:"src";s:120:"http://www.ntopsearch.com/media/images/f/b/fbc0ec93-0974-4d60-9cd0-e10e9f1b61da/fbc0ec93-0974-4d60-9cd0-e10e9f1b61da.jpg";}}}s:9:"post_meta";O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:8:"location";a:5:{s:3:"lat";s:8:"51.60961";s:3:"lng";s:9:"-2.814422";s:10:"center_lat";s:8:"51.60961";s:10:"center_lng";s:9:"-2.814422";s:7:"address";s:20:"Monmouthshire, Wales";}s:9:"telephone";s:16:"+44 01633 400465";s:5:"email";s:33:"info@thecourtyardcarrowhill.co.uk";s:7:"website";s:39:"http://www.thecourtyardcarrowhill.co.uk";s:10:"facilities";s:2606:"<ul>                                <li>                      <h4>Facilities</h4>                                                    <ul>                                                        <li><span>24 hr return laundry service</span></li>                                                        <li><span>Garden/patio for guests' use</span></li>                                                        <li><span>Ironing facilities </span></li>                                                        <li><span>Public telephone </span></li>                                                        <li><span>Welcome single sex groups</span></li>                                                        </ul>                                            </li>                                <li>                      <h4>Bedroom Facilities</h4>                                                    <ul>                                                        <li><span>Colour TV in all bedrooms</span></li>                                                        <li><span>Radio in all bedrooms</span></li>                                                        <li><span>Tea & coffee making facilities in all bedrooms</span></li>                                                        </ul>                                            </li>                                <li>                      <h4>Catering</h4>                                                    <ul>                                                        <li><span>Additional meal details</span></li>                                                        <li><span>Cater for vegetarians</span></li>                                                        <li><span>Serve evening meal</span></li>                                                        </ul>                                            </li>                                <li>                      <h4>Children's Facilities</h4>                                                    <ul>                                                        <li><span>Accept children</span></li>                                                        </ul>                                            </li>                                <li>                      <h4>Leisure Facilities</h4>                                                    <ul>                                                        <li><span>Other sporting facilities</span></li>                                                        </ul>                                            </li>                                </ul>";s:13:"accessibility";s:33:"<p>                          </p>";}}i:93;a:2:{s:4:"post";O:8:"stdClass":4:{s:10:"post_title";s:15:"The Guest House";s:12:"post_content";s:253:"<p>              A warm welcome awaits you at Jenny’s Guest House, a perfect base for your visit to Abergavenny, the gateway to South Wales and the Brecon Beacons.
